Assignment 1 on SceneBuilder and JavaFX

**Problem 1:**
You have to design a guessing game that has been demonstrated in the class. It will have two screens, the first one is the main game screen and the second one is the win/lose screen. In the first scene, you are to put in your name in a text field and press a button to save your name. Note that there is no alert when your name is put in the text field. Then you would have to generate a random number between (1 to 3) by pressing a button that is labeled as Generate. Then after generating the number you would have to guess the number and then press the corresponding circle thatâ€™s placed below the screen. At the top corner of the screen, there would be a counter that would track the remaining number of attempts that you have. At the start, there will be two attempts and the count would have a value of 2. When you wrongly guess the number and click on the wrong circle, then your attempts will reduce. When you wrongly guess two times and the attempts turn to 0, you would go to the next screen where you would be given the winning message. Now if you correctly guess the number while your attempts remain, then you  will be immediately taken to the next screen where you would be given the winning message. Note that if you input your name at the start in the input field, then the message would contain your name on the next screen.
